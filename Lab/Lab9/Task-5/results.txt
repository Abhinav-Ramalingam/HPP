SERIAL IMPLEMENTATION:
$ ./pi
PI is approx. 3.1415926535899894

PARALLEL IMPLEMENTATION:
$ ./ppi
PI is approx. 3.1415926535898682

SERIAL IS SLIGHTLY MORE ACCURATE: 
Adding a large number of smaller partial sums 
    - Can introduce rounding errors due to the way floating-point numbers are handled in computer memory.
