TRANSFORM_OPT:
Default:
transform_opt tests took   0.112 wall seconds.

Adding restrict:
transform_opt tests took   0.112 wall seconds.

Replace np with NP:
transform_opt tests took   0.112 wall seconds.

int NP to const int NP:
transform_opt tests took   0.024 wall seconds.

int NP but inside function definition:
transform_opt tests took   0.024 wall seconds.

const int NP but inside function definition:
transform_opt tests took   0.024 wall seconds.

TAKEAWAY:
* Declare small fixed constants as const at the global level to help the compiler with better optimizations.
* When possible, move constant values inside functions if they don’t need global scope.
