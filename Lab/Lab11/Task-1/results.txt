PRIVATE: (garbage values)
$ ./ds
a= 32536 b= 20
a= 20 b= 20
a= 20 b= 20
a= 20 b= 20

FIRSTPRIVATE: (Initialized in the parallel region with the value)
$ ./ds
a= 120 b= 20
a= 120 b= 20
a= 120 b= 20
a= 120 b= 20

LASTPRIVATE: (Without lastprivate) => Result fluctuates
LASTPRIVATE: (With lastprivate) => Result is Always Same

RESULTS:
In firstprivate, each thread gets local private copy of the global variable. 
So when the parallel region finishes, the original variable still holds its initial value, 
unaffected by the parallel computation.

In lastprivate, the last executed thread will copy back its private copy's value to the
original global variable.
