For 1 thread:
$ time ./omps
funcA() result: x = 1.648721
funcB() result: x = 2.718282

real    0m5,322s

For 2 threads:

funcB() result: x = 2.718282

real    0m2,671s

For 3 threads:
$ time ./omps

SUMMARY:
1 thread: The functions run sequentially, so the real time and user time are similar, and no parallelism is gained.
2 threads: Both functions are executed in parallel, leading to a significant reduction in real time while the user time remains 
the sum of both functions.
3 threads: No additional parallelism is gained, as only two sections are available. The real time stays similar to the 2-thread 
case, and the user time remains unchanged. However, there is a slight increase in sys time due to the overhead of creating an 
extra unused thread.
