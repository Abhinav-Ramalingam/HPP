RESULTS:
The problem occurs because compilers that do not support OpenMP cannot find the `omp.h` 
header, causing a compilation error. This is particularly problematic when using compilers 
like Clang, which may lack OpenMP support.

To fix this, the code can check for the `_OPENMP` preprocessor macro before including 
`omp.h` and calling OpenMP functions. This ensures that the program can compile both 
with and without OpenMP support, allowing it to run in parallel if OpenMP is available 
and serially if it is not.
